     * It turns the stream of search terms into a stream of Exchange arrays and assigns the result to the
     * exchanges property.
     *
     * Based off Observable example in the main Angular tutorial:
     * https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt6.html#
     *
     * We don't pass every user keystroke directly to the ExchangeHttpDataService, else we'd send a load of HTTP
     * requests! We achieve this by chaining Observable operators: debounceTime(200) and distinctUntilChanged.
     *
     * The switchMap calls the ExchangeHttpDataService for each search term that makes it through the debounce and
     * distinctUntilChanged checks. It cancels and discards previous search Observables, returning only the
     * latest ExchangeHttpDataService Observable.
     *
     * Every qualifying key event can trigger an HTTP method call. Even with a 200ms pause between requests,
     * there could be multiple HTTP requests in flight, and they may not return in the order sent.
     * switchMap preserves the original request order and only returns the Observable from the most recent HTTP
     * method call. Results from prior calls are canceled and discarded.
     *
     * If the search text is empty, we short-circuit the HTTP method call, and return an Observable containing the
     * first 8 Exchanges.
     *
     * NOTE: canceling the ExchangeHttpDataService observable won't actually abort a pending HTTP request. Angular does
     * not support this yet - it just discards unwanted results.
